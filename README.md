# Julian Sabos Resume
This is the repository corresponding to my resume, you can check it out on my personal page.
This is only a static page, nothing fancy but the differents CSS & JS libs used:
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
* [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
* [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/).

What are we talking here: HTML 5, CSS 3, JS Native.

This code was released in 2014 and nothing was updates so be indulgent ;)...
